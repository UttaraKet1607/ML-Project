# Predicting Cloud Coverage Using Machine Learning Techniques

## Background
Clouds are central to Earth's energy balance, weather systems, and climate dynamics. This project dives into the intricate relationships between cloud coverage and atmospheric variables, leveraging advanced machine learning (ML) techniques to enhance predictive weather models.

- Objective: Analyze and predict cloud coverage using data-driven approaches.
- Scope: Examine the interplay between atmospheric variables (temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.) and cloud behavior.
- Impact: Improve weather forecasting accuracy, enhance climate change assessment, and support informed decision-making.

## Data Overview
- Region: 15 cities in Colorado, selected for geographical and population diversity.
- Source: OpenWeatherMap 5-day Forecast API.
- Metrics: Temperature, humidity, wind speed, cloud coverage, and precipitation.
- Interval: 3-hour segments, spanning up to 40 time points.

## Tools
- Programming Language: Python
- Key Libraries:
  - requests: Fetch weather data via API calls.
  - pandas: Organize and clean data.
  - json: Store raw data for analysis.
